# Host Leader (1 hour):
One of the interviews will be conducted by a hiring manager from the Systems & Infrastructure organization. This person may, or may not, end up being the final hiring manager, but will be able to provide you with information on the different projects, engineering team culture, challenges, etc. He/she will be asking you about your career history, your job search (why youâ€™re looking, why is LinkedIn interesting, what technologies are you interested in), and an overview of interesting projects you worked on, and your involvement in these projects. They will also evaluate your thinking and problem-solving abilities: how do you figure out problems, develop solutions and alternatives, what is your decision-making process, your organizational fit, and your motivations.
