# Host Leader (1 hour):
One of the interviews will be conducted by a hiring manager from the Systems & Infrastructure organization. This person may, or may not, end up being the final hiring manager, but will be able to provide you with information on the different projects, engineering team culture, challenges, etc. He/she will be asking you about your career history, your job search (why you’re looking, why is LinkedIn interesting, what technologies are you interested in), and an overview of interesting projects you worked on, and your involvement in these projects. They will also evaluate your thinking and problem-solving abilities: how do you figure out problems, develop solutions and alternatives, what is your decision-making process, your organizational fit, and your motivations.


Manager 面，就是聊自己的项目，做过什么。遇到why linkedin那一段我答的特别差，读了LinkedIn的技术博客想和manager讨论下，结果发现讨论的那个项目正在deprecation path。。我- -# 午饭轮，聊他们组做什么，LinkedIn文化，什么是Azkaban。。这个我是真的不熟
嗯，why linkedin这个问题一定要好好准备，写个小作文是最好的。


 Manager面试，讲了简历，然后让你设计一个推荐系统，具体忘了

第五轮， hiring manager 问一些 behavior 问题， 还问了一个Espresso database设计过程中怎么处理hot point的问题，和key的rebalance有关系
