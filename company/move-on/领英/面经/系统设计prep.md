# Infrastructure Design and Implementation (3 modules, 1 hour each):  
- 所有IDI问题都涉及设计，虽然IDI被分成三个模块，但你不能假设某个模块中的概念不出现在其他模块。
- 对于所有模块，问清楚问题，提出你的假设，大胆思考并且说说tradeoffs.
- 没有完美的答案，除了最终solution，你整个module的表现也会被evaluate.
- Solutions评估标准：completeness, performance, scalability,是否fault tolerant.

## IDI1 Concurrency
This module focuses on the concepts related to concurrency. Specifically: threads, locks, semaphores, race conditions, shared memory and data structures.  You’ll be presented with a problem where there is resource contention (implicit or explicit) and you’ll need to address it. While you can take advantage of the primitives provided by your language of choice, you’re still expected to understand the concepts, guarantees and implications.  

## IDI2 Data Structures & Algorithms
This module focuses on data structures and algorithms. You’ll be given a problem and you’ll be expected to design one or more data structures that are able to solve the problem. You should be prepared to explain the algorithms and logic associated with the structure.  

## IDI3 Complex Systems
This module focuses on large (distributed) systems. You will be given a scenario and end goal and will be asked to design a system that can meet the requirements.  You’re expected to understand how to break down a problem into components and how the components interact with each other. You should be able to describe the solution at a high level and go into the detail of each component.
