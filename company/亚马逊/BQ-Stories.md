S: 有一个engineering manager问我们为什么不能给tvc kudos，因为绝大多数他的reports是tvc？我们一般会有一个模板解释为什么. 
   并且给除了其他的rationales. 但是他锲而不舍的问，我们的policy中试图找漏洞，并且将ticket assign给了他自己\
A: 将ticket设置为new并且安抚他我们会将此ticket放在我们radar上\
R: 有一天有个组接触我们开始详谈是否可以为tvc专门做一个app叫gAppreciate, 然后我们将此ticket转给了他，

S: Bulk Kudos. 开始于4月初，计划用一个quarter完成这个任务，开始完成了一半，设计文档写完了，还有两个月有mid year perf review,
   后来来了两个的FR, link feature, 我和BA和PM review our backlog tickets,发现不少REQUEST for this feature.
A: 两个都有不少tickets. 决策理由，nice to have vs better to have. 
   我们经过讨论决定pivot到新的功能，那个时候刚设计完第一个问题，我思考完告诉manager最好先完成code refactoring work，不然就会
   totally leave this work unfinished, 当未来重新写这这feature时我们可以直接写新功能，set up code structure first
R: 用了一周完成了code refactoring，然后开始新的工作。

A: 我认为我刚解除了a11y这块领域并且当时我的项目正在维护阶段，于是我认为我也应该帮助组里另外两个项目，我向manager提出了请求，volunteer to work together
