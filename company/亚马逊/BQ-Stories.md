S: 有一个engineering manager问我们为什么不能给tvc kudos，因为绝大多数他的reports是tvc？我们一般会有一个模板解释为什么. 并且给除了其他的rationales. 但是他锲而不舍的问，别且在我们的policy中试图找漏洞，并且将ticket assign给了他自己\
A: 将ticket设置为new并且安抚他我们会将此ticket放在我们radar上\
R: 有一天有个组接触我们开始详谈是否可以为tvc专门做一个app叫gAppreciate. 然后我们将此ticket转给了他，虽然我们不是解决了这个问题但我们一直记住了customer的需求

S: 收到一些关于typos or errors的tickets. 我们通常的做法是让admin删除并重新上传，后来我们遇到了一个memegen，有人换了last name希望能把之前的context改了，还有类似的抱怨。\
A: 我思考了一下完成改动award内容这个feature的时间，其实不长。并且查了一下我们的ticket backlogs发现这个功能适用于很多情况。我联系了我们POps Specialist查询了修改award的情况是否是一个经常发生的事情\
R: 我在biweekly主动提了这个功能，并且展示了这个功能解决的用户痛点。然后展示了自己需要完成这个工作的时间，如何不影响接下来的安排。然后把这个任务完成了。
