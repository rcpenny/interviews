# Class Diagram
Class diagram is the backbone of object-oriented modeling - it shows how different entities (people, things, and data) relate to each other. In other words, it shows the static structures of the system.

A class diagram describes the attributes and operations of a class and also the constraints imposed on the system. Class diagrams are widely used in the modeling of object-oriented systems because they are the only UML diagrams that can be mapped directly to object-oriented languages.

The purpose of the class diagram can be summarized as:

1. Analysis and design of the static view of an application;
2. To describe the responsibilities of a system;
3. To provide a base for component and deployment diagrams; and,
4. Forward and reverse engineering.

A class is depicted in the class diagram as a rectangle with three horizontal sections, as shown in the figure below. The upper section shows the class’s name (Flight), the middle section contains the properties of the class, and the lower section contains the class’s operations (or “methods”).
